Improve query parameter handling and add logging for real estate listing endpoint

- Refactored query parameter handling to properly parse and apply default values
- Converted boolean string parameters (offer, furnished, parking) to MongoDB query objects
- Ensured type parameter defaults to searching for both 'sale' and 'rent' listings
- Added logging of constructed queries and results to aid in debugging
- Enhanced sorting logic to properly apply ascending or descending order based on the order parameter

These changes enhance the robustness of the listing retrieval function and make it easier
